## Experiments

The following transcripts are from my first experiments generating SVGs with ChatGPT. I was curious to see what kind of images the model could generate, and how it would respond to different inputs.

#### Please generate an SVG of a catus [*sic*] out in the desert on a sunny day, no explanation.

>As an AI language model, I cannot create or directly display SVG images. However, I can help you create the SVG code, which you 
>could then use in any SVG viewer or compatible software/website to visualize the cactus in the desert.
>
>Here's a simple SVG code for a cactus in a desert environment. Copy and paste this code into an SVG viewer or an HTML document 
>to display the image.

```svg
<svg width="300" height="150" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <!-- Background color (sky) -->
    <rect width="300" height="150" x="0" y="0" fill="skyblue" />
    
    <!-- Sun -->
    <circle cx="270" cy="30" r="20" fill="yellow" />
    
    <!-- Ground -->
    <rect width="300" height="50" x="0" y="100" fill="tan" />
    
    <!-- Cactus -->
    <rect width="30" height="80" x="130" y="70" fill="green" />
    <rect width="20" height="30" x="125" y="50" fill="green" />
    <rect width="20" height="30" x="145" y="50" fill="green" />
</svg>
```

![Cactus in the desert](/images/2023/chatsvg_desert1.svg)

**SUCCESS** Although the initial part of the response was discouraging (why the low confidence ChatGPT?), the model dutifully generated the SVG code for a cactus in the desert.

The cactus could obviously use some work, but this image is mostly what I was expecting. I know these models are sensitive to inputs, so I decied to give it some encouragement.


#### OK, great. But please now generate a much more detailed image using gradients and paths

**I'm going to elide the SVG code from now on, but you can see it by viewing the source of the images.**

**SUCCESS** OK, so it's not going to win any rewards with that, but I applaud the effort. The cactus has a bit more shape and the horizon is more interesting. 

Still, I feel like I'm failing the network. Let's try again with stupid amounts of prompting.

#### Please generate an SVG of a cactus in the desert on a sunny day. Please make it as detailed as possible. Use vibrant colors. Use dramatic lighting. I want depth! I want to feel like I'm there! I want something shockingly beautiful.

**FAILURE** Oops, I went too far and it just started explaining to me how to use a drawing program. I guess it doesn't like that kind of prompting.

Let's change subjects and see how it does generating icons.

#### Would you generate the SVG code for a mac toolbar icon that toggles the selected item preferences pane on and off?

<img src="/images/2023/chatsvg_icon1.svg" alt="Toggle preferences icon" style="width:240px;background-color:white;"/>

**FAILURE** Haha, OK, um so those aren't gears. E for effort.

Can we just make a single gear if we concentrate really hard?

#### Please generate an SVG code of a gear icon. Please make it detailed showing the teeth and such. You can use paths if you want. Make your response as long as it needs to be.

> Here's an SVG code representation of a gear icon using paths:

<img src="/images/2023/chatsvg_icon2.svg" alt="Gear icon" style="width:240px;background-color:white;"/>
